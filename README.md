# password-generator
This application will help you create a truly secure password and write it into a separate file.

# How it works
Once launched, the application will ask you to enter the name of the service for which you are generating the password. This is done so that after automatic writing to a separate file, you know exactly what service this password is for.
```
Enter service name: GitHub
```
Then the application will ask you to enter the password length.
```
Enter password length: 16
```

As a result, you will have a file named **"myPWs.txt"** which will contain your password with the name of the service.
